# Sym-Modes

This repo is for Python scripts created by the Materials Theory and Design Group to help with symmetry mode analysis.
If you questions, Nicholas can be contacted at monsieurwagner@gmail.com

Structure_Aligner.py is designed to generate interpolated VASP structures between a high symmetry parent phase and a lower symmetry child phase. A group-subgroup relationship should exist between the two space groups, and both structures should be aligned so that c is the long axis.
